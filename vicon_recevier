INSTALLATION:

INSIDE THE OWN WORKSPACE SRC FOLDER, CLONE THE REPOSITORY ROS2_VICON_RECEIVER:
git clone https://github.com/OPT4SMART/ros2-vicon-receiver

INSTALL DATASTREAM SDK AND OTHER LIBRARIES, SO LAUNCH:
./install_libs.sh

BUILDING PACKAGE:
cd vicon_receiver
colcon build --symlink-install

THERE MUST BE PRESENT ALSO PX4_MSGS DIRECTORY INSIDE WORKSPACE SRC:
git clone https://github.com/PX4/px4_msgs.git ~/px4_ros_com_ros2/src/px4_msgs

AND PX4_ROS_COM:
git clone https://github.com/PX4/px4_ros_com.git ~/px4_ros_com_ros2/src/px4_ros_com:

IN ORDER TO BUILD THEM, USE:
cd ~/px4_ros_com_ros2/src/px4_ros_com/scripts
source build_ros2_workspace.bash

---
NODE LAUNCH:

IN ORDER TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
source vicon_receiver/install/setup.bash
ros2 launch vicon_receiver client.launch.py

REMEMBER TO SET IP ADDRESS OF THE MACHINE RUNNING VICON APP MODYFING 'hostname' INSIDE 'client.launch.py' FILE INSIDE LAUNCH FOLDER

---
TROUBLESHOOTING:

- THERE IS A TYPO IN THE 'CMakeList.txt' FILE INSIDE 'vicon_receiver' DIRECTORY, AT LINE #38 ---> THE CORRECT LINE IS
ament_target_dependencies(vicon_client "rclcpp" "rcutils")
